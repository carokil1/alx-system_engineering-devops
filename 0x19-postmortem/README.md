## Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

### Issue Summary
- **Duration:** The outage lasted from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM EST on November 10, 2023.
- **Impact:** Approximately 60% of our users experienced slow response times and intermittent downtime accessing our main web service. The service's API responses were delayed, causing cascading effects on dependent services.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured load balancer failed to distribute traffic evenly across servers, leading to an overload on a subset of servers.

### Timeline
- **10:00 AM** - Outage detected when automated monitoring alerts flagged high error rates.
- **10:05 AM** - Initial investigation by the DevOps team suggested server overload. Additional monitoring data was sought.
- **10:30 AM** - A customer complaint via support ticket confirmed the issue was widespread.
- **11:00 AM** - Investigation revealed uneven load distribution. Misleading server logs initially suggested a network issue.
- **12:00 PM** - Incident escalated to the network engineering team.
- **1:00 PM** - Network team ruled out network issues; focus returned to load balancer configuration.
- **2:00 PM** - Corrected load balancer settings and redistributed server load.
- **2:30 PM** - Service fully restored; monitoring confirmed normal operation.

### Root Cause and Resolution
- **Cause:** The load balancer was incorrectly configured during a recent update, which led to some servers being overwhelmed while others were underutilized.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings were corrected to ensure even traffic distribution. Servers that were overwhelmed were restarted to clear the backlog.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Review and enhance the load balancer configuration process.
  - Implement a more robust change management protocol for critical infrastructure updates.
- **Task List:**
  - **Task 1:** Audit current load balancer settings across all environments.
  - **Task 2:** Develop a comprehensive checklist for infrastructure changes.
  - **Task 3:** Implement an automated testing procedure for load balancer configurations post-update.
  - **Task 4:** Conduct training sessions for the DevOps team on advanced load balancing strategies.
  - **Task 5:** Upgrade monitoring systems to detect uneven load distribution across servers.
